    <h1>Visit the Website</h1>
</div>
This website works like a blog, and it actually is.It works on SQL database ( relational database); here you can register your own account and it also provides a personal data endpoint based dinamically on each account logged in.<br>
You can, obviously, write your own posts, load images on each post, see all posts you wrote, search posts by word or by username/author in a search bar.<br>
The main feature, though, is that each post you'll write (author, datetime, text) will be saved on blockchain, via Infura, and you'll see the blockchain's transaction id below your post.<br>
If you want, try it and let me know what do you think about, thanks.
